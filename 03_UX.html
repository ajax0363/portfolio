          <p>
            03_UX shoved us that UX-design is a solid component of the
            development of digital user interfaces and the workareas, tools and
            methods are used in all of the five themes this first semester.
            03_UX has given us a fundamental understanding of the interaction
            between user and user interfaces, furthermore witch theories, tools
            and methods are used for researching, designing and testing in a
            digital product-development. we have learned that the understanding
            of this interaction is very important for the future designchoices
            and product-development. they are based on concrete insights about
            the users instead of immediate assumptions.

            we have worked with UX-methods and were giving an understanding
            regarding the presentation of our product and how to pitch our
            research- and test-results for a potential client, the best way
            possible. in 03_UX we focused on research-methods, analyzing sites,
            and content-development - especially copywriting and furthermore UI
            conventions, prototyping and testing. based on this knowledge we
            designed and created our own website in adobe XD focusing on user
            experience, copywriting, UI-elements and creating a functional
            website.
