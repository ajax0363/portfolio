          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <p>
            04_animation introduced us to javascript, which were soon shown to
            be a necessity to coding advanced and dynamic websites as well as
            creating interactive elements such as: burgermenus, slideshows,
            games etc. we focused on the fundamental principles within design
            and the programming of digital solutions - especially looking at the
            structure and layout of the userface. we analyzed game-design and
            how it engaged the user through UI-elements, character-elements,
            background-design and composition techniques.

          <p>
            this theme focussed on the creation of a game using javascript and
            css animations. we had to come up with a concept and an idea and we
            had to design all elements from the bottom. 04_animation focused on
            the journey working with shaping of graphic elements and making them
            work in practise. we were introduced to the importance of working
            with an activity- and state machine-diagram - which is used for
            planning the complicated interactive flow in the game. furthermore
            sketchingteniques, moodboards and styletiles.
